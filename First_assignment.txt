Hello Students,

This is what you have to do for homework.
Remember the deadline to submit the HW is Wenesday at 8:00:00 am.

I. Read chapter 2 from the book Introduction to Scientific Computing for Biologists Author.   
The book is downloadable here: https://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IntroSciComp2014.pdf

II. Answer the following question. What does this do?   

1. ls [A-Z]*
	 ls- lists the files in the directory # Correct!
	[A-Z]*- lists information about the files in the current directory and sorts them alphabetically (if sort is not specified) while defining a class of characters. # Actually this is telling the computer that list files in uppercase.
	 ls [A-Z]*- lists the directory while defining a class of characters, listing the information about the files. # Read comment above!
2. cp *.sh /tmp
	cp- copies files and directories # Correct!
	*.sh /tmp- copies the sourse to the destination/ multiples sources to directory # You can be more specific and mention what is being copied and where.
3. man pwd # Correct!
	man- an interface to the on-line reference manuals, shows help page of a command # Correct!
	pwd- shows the current directory # Correct!
	man pwd- will show the help page on the current directory # Inorrect! help page for `pwd`
4. cd ~
	cd- changes directory # Correct!
	cd ~ - goes to your home directory # Correct!
5. mkdir -p /test1/test2/test3 
	mkdir- creates a directory # Correct!
	-p -adds more detail # Incorrect!! your answer bellow refers to what `-p` is doing.
	mkdir -p /test1/test2/test3 -creates the directory test3 and test 1 and test 2 if they do not already exist
6. cp -r /tmp .
	cp- copies a file # Correct!
	cp -r -copies a directory recursively including all the sub directories and files # Incorrect! Here `-r` doesnt meand recursively. It's been used to copy directories 
	/tmp -temporary files #Correct! But is a directory
	cp -r /tmp . -copies a temporary files #Correct! 
7. ls | less
	ls- list the files in the directory
	less- progressively prints a file on the screen
	ls | less- print on the screen the list of files in the directory # What is less doing here ??? 
8. head -n 24 test.txt » abc.txt
	head- prints the first few lines of a file Correct!
	-n -shows the line number Correct!
	head -n 24 test.txt » abc.txt -will print the first few lines of a file, number the lines, obtain number 24, move it from test.txt into abc.text (appending 24 into the existing file abc.txt)  Correct!
9. echo "aaa" > aaa.txt 
	echo- print a string Correct!
	echo "aaa" > aaa.txt -will print "aaa" into aaa.txt Correct!
10. ps -u sallesina
	ps- will report a snapshot of the current processes Correct!
	-u -will select by effect user ID or name Correct! Try it with your username in hoffman
	ps -u sallesine -will report a snapshot of the current progress of the effective user sallesine (the userlist) Correct!
11. top
	top- displays Linux tasks Correct! Try it in hoffman
12. ls | grep .sh | xargs mv /tmp
	ls- lists the files in the directory #Correct!
	grep- matches strings in a file #Correct!
	.sh- command interpreter of shell #Correct!
	xargs- builds and executes command lines from standard input #Correct!

	ls | grep .sh | xargs mv /tmp -will list and match strings the file in the directory in the shell to move/ rename the temporary file 
        #Incorrect! Takes output of ls names and sends the names into grep. Grep then will search the shell for these specific directories or files and send located ones as input to xargs mv /tmp command which adds the files output by grep to the tmp folder. 
	
13. du -sk /home/* | sort -r -n | head -10
	du -sk /home/* sort -r -n |head -10 -will print files in the current directory and subdirectories in order of size for the first 10 strings of the file into the home directory #Incorrect! Check what `du -sk` is doing 
14. sort -r names.txt
	sort- will sort the lines of a file and print the results
	-r -reverse the result of comparisions
	- -modifies the program's behavior 
	sort -r names.txt -will sort the line of names.txt and reverse the results # Correct!
